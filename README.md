Data set: Youth Tobacco Survey
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/youth-tobacco-survey-yts-data

Dataset Description:
The Youth Tobbaco Survey (YTS) was developed to provide states with comprehensive data on both middle school and high school students regarding tobacco use, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking cessation, school curriculum, minors' ability to purchase or otherwise obtain tobacco products, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco, and familiarity with pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco media messages. The YTS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in middle schools (grades 6–8) and high schools (grades 9–12). The data for the STATE System were extracted from Youth Tobacco Surveys from participating states. Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, smokeless tobacco products prevalence and quit attempts.

Dataset Content(s):
Each row within our dataset is a youth tobacco survey entry conducted according to the recorded year. The important columns we have focused on within this dataset are the year the YTS was conducted (YEAR), the state in which it was conducted(LocationDesc), the topic type being “tobacco usage” for all data entries(TopicType), the detailed description of that topic (TopicDesc), the source of our data (DataSource), the responses from the YTS (Response), the data value(Data_Value) and its data type (Data_Value_Type), which genders were focused per survey (Gender), what races were observed (Race), the age group(s) observed (Age), and the education level of the student(s) (Education).

Dataset Questions: 

Question 1:   How does education level affect the levels of which survey respondents use tobacco over time?
  This question is meaningful because it is a topic that is relatively frequently researched. It is known that education level from middle to highschool shows a very distinct age range, and age is a strong indicator of brain development, and therefore, this question is more-so linking age and brain development and using tobacco products. This is also a question which can be very useful for parents with children around this age; Some parents are very oblivious to assume “no, my middle or highschooler does not use tobacco products.” This display clearly shows that that is not true for many children of that age from this data set. In light of many recent campaigns to encourage open conversations between parents and their children regarding drug/alcohol safety, a display such as this will encourage parents to bridge that gap and join this movement of more open conversations about safety, as this is undeniable that an increasing number of middle schooler over time as well and an even higher about of highschoolers over time have used tobacco products.

Question 2: How does the amount of people/density of people who frequently smoke change over time by state?
